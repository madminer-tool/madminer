    ### NOTE:

    ### There are multiple types of release trigger events.
    ### Ref: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#release
    ###
    ### Given that GitHub allows the creation of 'release'
    ### and 'pre-release' publications to differentiate between
    ### production and beta releases, the trigger type to use,
    ### as it wraps them both, must be 'published'.
